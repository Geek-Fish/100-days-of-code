# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed Unity and set up project. Created the 'click to add force' code to get the ball moving. 

**Thoughts:** Unity is a lot easier to use than I thought. C# is like riding a bike... You never forget it :)

### Day 2: December 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added the beginning of the aiming system (circle on the ball), created a camera rig to move the camera around and also turned off the gravity. 

**Thoughts:** Got a lot done in an hour. Tomorrow I will add trajectory to the aiming system
